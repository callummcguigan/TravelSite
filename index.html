  <h3>What is travel insurance?</h3>
  <p>Travel insurance covers you against any cost or losses if something should go wrong when you’re on holiday. Whether you’re travelling abroad or in the UK, travel insurance helps you if your holiday plans are disrupted or your accommodation gets cancelled, and is essential in the event that you injure yourself or if your possessions are stolen, lost, or damaged while travelling.</p>
<br><br>
  <h3>What types of travel insurance are there?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Single trip: this covers you for a single trip to the destination(s), for as long as you’re away.</li>
    <li>Annual multi-trip: this covers you for a full year, allowing you to take multiple holidays without re-purchasing insurance</li>
    <li>Backpacking: this will cover you for an extended period across multiple destinations.</li>
  </ul>
<br><br>
  <h3>How much does travel insurance cost?</h3>
  <p>The cost of travel insurance varies according to a number of factors, such as where you’re going, how long you’re away for and any extra cover that you need. The price of travel insurance starts from £4.79 – that’s how much an 18-year-old going to France for three days would pay for a single trip policy. Annual multi-trip travel insurance is more expensive, since it covers you for a whole year. This type of policy would cost £10.69 for an 18-year-old taking trips to Europe, with the cost of worldwide cover rising to £19.45.</p>
