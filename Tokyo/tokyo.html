  <h2>Things To Do In Tokyo</h2>

    <div class="col-md">
      <h3>Shibamata</h3>
      Shibamata is a neighborhood on the eastern end of Tokyo, not far from the Edogawa River which is the natural border between Tokyo and Chiba Prefecture. The town retains its old-school charm from yesteryear and is a perfect break away from modern Tokyo. One of the main attractions to see is the Shibamata Taishakuten Temple not far from the station. The town sees few foreign tourists but is widely recognized by older Japanese as the hometown of Tora-san, the protagonist of a highly popular movie series, Otoko wa Tsurai yo ("It is tough being a man") which was filmed from 1969 to 1995. There are several nods to the series like the bronze statues of Tora-san and his sister, Sakura, who greet visitors outside Shibamata Station.

    <div class="col-md">
      <h3>The Ghibli Museum</h3>
      The Ghibli Museum is the animation and art museum of Miyazaki Hayao's Studio Ghibli, one of Japan's most famous animation studios. They have produced many feature length films with worldwide distribution such as My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea. Located in Mitaka, just outside of central Tokyo, the museum is a must-see for fans of the films. The museum itself is whimsically designed in the distinct style of the studio's films, and many of their famous characters are there, including a life-sized robot from "Castle in the Sky" in the rooftop garden.

      <h3>The Sanja Festival</h3>
      The Sanja Festival is an annual festival in the Asakusa district that usually takes place over the third full weekend in May. It is held in celebration of the three founders of Sensoji Temple, who are enshrined in Asakusa Shrine next door to the temple. Nearly two million people visit Asakusa over the three days of the festival, making it one of Tokyo's most popular festivals. The Sanja Matsuri features about one hundred portable shrines (mikoshi) in which Shinto deities (kami) are symbolically placed into and paraded about the streets to bring good fortune to the local businesses and residents. Smaller neighborhood mikoshi can be seen about the streets of Asakusa throughout the festival, while the focus of the festival, the three large mikoshi belonging to Asakusa Shrine, make their appearance on Sunday. For the entirety of the festival, Asakusa is packed with food stalls, festival games and revelers amid a lively atmosphere of Japanese drums and flutes.

      <h3>Tokyo Disneyland</h3>
      Tokyo Disneyland is a theme park based on the films produced by Walt Disney. It was opened in 1983 as the first Disney theme park outside of the United States. Modeled after Disneyland in California and the Magic Kingdom in Florida, Tokyo Disneyland is made up of seven themed lands and features seasonal decorations and parades. Tokyo Disneyland is a five minute walk from JR Maihama Station. It can also be reached in a few steps from the Tokyo Disneyland Station along the Disney Resort Monorail.
